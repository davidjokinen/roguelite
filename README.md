# Rougelite
Aiming to build a game

## Current playable version
[https://roguelite-3rkvm.ondigitalocean.app/](https://roguelite-3rkvm.ondigitalocean.app/)
It updates everytime I push.

## Getting it working
1. Install Node.js (or update it newer is (generally) better!)
2. run `npm install` 
3. run `npm run watch` or `npm run build` in `./game` to build the javascript.
5. run `npm run start` in `./game-server` to run the server (Its a static HTML server)
5. Game should be up and running!
